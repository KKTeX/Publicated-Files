Description:
------------
This package provides the \undernote command for placing short annotations
directly below words or phrases in the main text, connected by a ruled line.

It is designed for LuaLaTeX (especially for vertical typesetting with luatexja),
and automatically adjusts note positions, avoiding overlap between multiple
annotations on the same line.  
Horizontal typesetting is also supported.
